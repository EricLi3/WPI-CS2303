How to use: 
Assuming that you are in the right directory and have the data files downloaded, Type "make" or "mingw32-make" into the terminal and hit enter 
determing if you are using a windows machine or not. This will generate the output and execuable files. Then type "./analysis.exe" to the terminal,
and you will hopefully see 3 new .txt files appear in your directory. You can then open these files to asccess the information. 


Sources : I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/ to help me develop an algorithm for sorting the array. The bubble sort algorithm checks
two adjacent elements, and if say the second one is greater than the first one, we will swap them, using a temp variable. We will do this process until
the array is in the correct order which depends if you want it increasing or decreasing order. I also used google to search up syntax
such as using && in a for loop.
