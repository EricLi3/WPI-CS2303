Program : coffee_shop_sales.c

Summary: This program reads in the sales reports for the last 6 months. It then makes 3 sales_reports; Total_sales.txt, Profits.txt, and Top_earners.txt . 
Total_sales.txt contains a list of each item and the total number fo sales for the item. Profits.txt contains the total sales, total cost, amount earned, 
and profit for each item. Finally, Top_earners.txt lists the top 10 items with the highest revenue. We hope this program will help you and your business
prosper. 

How to use: 
Assuming that you are in the right directory and have your data files downloaded, Type "make" or "mingw32-make" into the terminal and hit enter 
determing if you are using a windows machine or not. This will generate the output and execuable files. Then type "./analysis.exe" to the terminal,
and you will hopefully see 3 new .txt files appear in your directory. You can then open these files to asccess the information. You can also type 
gcc coffee_shop_sales.c calculations.c -analysis.exe and get the same result.
